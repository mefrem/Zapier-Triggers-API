nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "User ownership verification enforced before all operations. Generic 404 responses prevent user enumeration. Audit logging captures all operations with user_id."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Expected p95 latency 11-16ms for DELETE (target <20ms), 15-25ms for ACK (target <50ms). Performance breakdown documented. Load test with 5000 concurrent requests recommended."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "DynamoDB atomic operations ensure consistency. Idempotent ACK design safe for retries. Error handling for 401, 404, 500 scenarios documented."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear HTTP semantics (204 for DELETE, 200 for ACK). REST conventions followed. Audit trail enables compliance audits."
